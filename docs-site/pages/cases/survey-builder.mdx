# Case Study — Customer Feedback Survey Builder

**Goal:** capture actionable customer insight in < 2 minutes to drive sprint priorities.

## Problem
Teams delay feedback loops; generic tools lack context; sentiment and tone are ignored.

## Solution
- AI-generated, context-aware templates (product type, sentiment, brand voice)
- Instant distribution (QR + short links), no login friction
- One-click CSV export → backlog insights

## Outcomes
- Validated with 100+ enterprise client scenarios (concept testing)
- Feedback-to-action latency reduced from days → minutes
- “Customer Obsession” as a workflow, not a slogan

## Stack
GPT-4 / Claude, Figma flows, Markdown; future: Next.js + Typeform API

## CLI Demo (concept)
```bash
npm run generate-survey -- --context="mobile-app-ux" --tone="empathetic"
npm run export-insights
